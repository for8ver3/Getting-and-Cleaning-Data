Title: Data collected by accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone


1. subjectID
  Unique individual subject identification number 
  
2. activityID
  Different activities, category 1 to 6, corresponding to column 3 (activityType)
  
3. activityType
  Different activities: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING"
  
4-69
  Mean_: average of each variable for each activity and each subject
  Time: time domain signals were captured at 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass 
        Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was 
        then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another 
        low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
  Frequency: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of the signals to produce frequency domain signals. 
  Body: body. 
  Gravity: gravity. 
  Acc: acceleration (from accelerometer). 
  Gyro: angular velocity (from gyroscope). 
  Jerk: linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain jerk signals. 
  Mag: magnitude of above 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 
  Mean: average
  StdDev: standard deviation
  XYZ: 3 different axial raw signals
